      <p>This is a boilerplate Registry Definition as required by [[w3c-process]] for  <a>w3c registries</a>.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Replace the text in this section with some

      <p>This document is intended to be used as the basis for  <a>w3c registries</a> for
        the W3C <a>TTWG</a>.
        The [[w3c-process]] sets out requirements for such  <a>w3c registries</a>,
        and defines core concepts like
        <dfn data-cite="w3c-process#registry-definition">registry definition</dfn>
        and <dfn data-cite="w3c-process#registry-table">registry table</dfn>.</p>
      <p><a>Registry definitions</a> need to fulfil certain criteria,
        including specifying custodianship, the change process,
        and defining the <a>registry table</a> itself.</p>
      <p>The text in the <a href="#registry-definition"></a> section can be
        used to meet those criteria and allow more rapid creation of
        registries without having to create new text each time.</p>

        to facilitate adoption.</p>
