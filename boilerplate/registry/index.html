      <p>This is a boilerplate Registry Definition as required for Registries by [[w3c-process]].</p>
      <p>The intent is that this boilerplate can form the basis of [=w3c registries=] for
        the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a> (TTWG).</p>
      <p>See discussion <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ttwg/discussions/241">w3c/ttwg#241</a> for
        details of the assumptions made to generate this document.</p>

      <p>This document is intended to be the basis of other Registry documents
        published by TTWG and is not intended to be published as a Registry itself.
        The following SOTD text is auto-generated by the Respec tool to reflect
        what an actual Registry Definition document would contain.</p>

      <h3>Registry Table(s)</h3>
      <p>This section defines constraints on Registry Tables. Each Registry Table consists of a the set of Registry Entries.</p>
      <section id="registry-entries">
        <h4>Registry Entries</h4>
        <p>Each registry entry has a status, a unique key, and
          if appropriate, other fields, for example any notes,
          a description, or a reference to some other
          defining entity.
        </p>

        <section id="registry-entry-status">
          <h5>Status</h5>
          <p>The registry entry status field reflects the maturity of that entry. Permitted values are:</p>
          <pre>
            Provisional
            Final
            Deprecated
          </pre>
          <p>No other values are permitted.</p>
          <section id="provisional-entry">
            <h6>Provisional</h6>
            <p>Registry entries with a status of <code>Provisional</code> MAY be changed, made final, deprecated or deleted.</p>
            <p>Registry entry keys in Provisional entries that were deleted MAY be reused.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="final-entry">
            <h6>Final</h6>
            <p>Registry entries with a status of <code>Final</code> MAY be deprecated and MUST NOT be deleted or changed.</p>
            <p>Registry entry keys in Final entries MUST NOT be reused.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="deprecated-entry">
            <h6>Deprecated</h6>
            <p>Registry entries with a status of <code>Deprecated</code> MAY be reinstated to Final, and MUST NOT be deleted or changed.</p>
            <p>Registry entry keys in Deprecated entries that were previously Provisional and never Final MAY be reused.</p>
            <p>Registry entry keys in Provisional entries that were previously Final MUST NOT be reused.</p>

      <h2>Registry Table(s)</h2>

    </section>
    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        No conformance requirements are permitted in Registries.
        If there are conformance requirements associated with
        registry entries, then they must be defined in the
        referencing specification.
      </p>
      <section id="referencing-specifications">
        <h3>Referencing Specifications</h3>
        <p>Although the formal definition of a Registry includes
          the referencing specifications,
          there is no need to list those referencing specifications
          in the Registry itself; doing so is optional.
